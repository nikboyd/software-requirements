### Discussion

A [mission][mission] statement can make a difference, especially when properly formulated.
A [mission][mission] statement should reflect the intended ends of an organization, rather than its means.

* _Ends versus Means._ <br/>An ends statement describes the difference an organization intends to make in the world, rather than merely describing what staff will be doing (the means) to effect those ends.
* _Effects versus Efforts._ <br/>A well-formed ends statement describes the results and effects to be achieved by staff, rather than their efforts and [activities][activity].

Ends are best expressed as effects that are qualitative (valuable) changes in the world.
Thus, ends are best expressed using adjectives that describe the intended effects,
i.e., a state (of being) to be achieved.
Descriptive adjectives especially indicate such states of being.
