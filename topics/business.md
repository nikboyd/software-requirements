### Discussion

A [business][business] tends (or intends) to create [value][value] for its shareholders
(if for-profit) and its constituents (those otherwise served or interested),
whether or not the [business][business] is conducted for profit.

[Value][Value] creation results from changes to (and [improvements][improvement] in the quality of) the world as effects.
Sometimes, the [value][value] of the changes results in monetary exchanges,
esp. when someone pays for the benefits received.
Sometimes, the [value][value] is intrinsic to the changes themselves.
