### Discussion

A software solution solves some specific (kinds of) problem(s).
Problems typically involve multiple elements from the real world (where they are situated).
Thus, a problem can usually be decomposed into several component elements, and these [components][component]
are often represented in the structure of the software solution.

Because software [solutions][solution] intend to enable or improve the conduct of some [business][business] [activities][activity],
most software [solutions][solution] provide some kind of user experience for collecting, manipulating, and
presenting information, whether using a desktop computer, a laptop computer, or a mobile device
(phone, tablet, etc.). Some of the software [components][component] surface these user experiences through [dialogs][dialog].
The [dialogs][dialog] engage users in conversations (of a kind) for
collecting, manipulating, and presenting information.
