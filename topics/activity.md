### Discussion


A [business][business] accomplishes its [mission][mission] in the world through its [activities][activity].
And, its [activities][activity] need to be kept in alignment with its purposes.
So, the [qualities][qualities] associated with those [activities][activity]
warrant [measurement][measurement] in order to manage and [improve][improve] their conduct.

The [activities][activity] of a [business][business] can be broadly categorized as those
that are [mission][mission] critical, [mission][mission] central, and [mission][mission] peripheral,
depending on whether and how the [activities][activity] are related to
the overall [business][business] [mission][mission] and [vision][vision].
Even though peripheral to its [mission][mission], some [activities][activity] are
supportive and essential, and thus still required to
accomplish the [business][business] [mission][mission].

For example, a [business][business] of nearly any size will require some employees,
and specific regulatory policies will be in place within a legal framework
for appropriately hiring and firing employees.
So, while the [activities][activity] associated with employee management may not
be considered a [mission][mission] critical [component][component] of the [business][business],
the associated issues will still require address and may warrant
some level of automation through some software [solution][solution](s).
