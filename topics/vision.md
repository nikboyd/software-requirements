### Discussion

A [vision][vision] statement succinctly expresses a durable purpose,
the quality concerns congruent with that purpose,
and potential outcome(s) with respect to that purpose and those concerns.
By remaining focused on outcomes (as ends), a [vision][vision]
statement provides the basis for aligning a [mission][mission] with its purpose.
As with [mission][mission] statements, a [vision][vision] statement needs to focus on:


* _Ends versus Means._ <br/>An ends statement describes the difference an organization intends to make in the world, rather than merely describing what staff will be doing (the means) to effect those ends.
* _Effects versus Efforts._ <br/>A well-formed ends statement describes the results and effects to be achieved by staff, rather than their efforts and [activities][activity].


Hence, an ends statement should not include verbs, which are
indicative of [activities][activity] (efforts) rather than effects.
However, where a [mission][mission] statement will tend to include
scope and situate that within a [value][value] chain,
a [vision][vision] statement will more often tend toward more
expansiveness, or simply leave out such scoping,
as the intended scope may ultimately be global, or impact
all partners, suppliers, and customers within a [value][value] chain.
