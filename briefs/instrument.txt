Instruments measure activities, mainly through counters or averaged rates (typically over time), or reported events.
Within a software solution, instruments will report their data points through some kind of telemetry,
which may include event logging, or a regular report with a "heart beat".
Downstream systems can then analyze the data provided for patterns and produce alerts and alarms, for example
when some critical threshold is crossed.
