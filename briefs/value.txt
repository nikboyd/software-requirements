A business produces value for its beneficiaries through its activities.
Some activities of a business may save its beneficiaries time or money or both.
Whether directly or indirectly, the purpose of a business and its activities in the world are to provide a valuable benefit.

The degree to which a business produces such benefits can be measured, and thereby motivates the funding of its activities.
Also, business activities themselves have qualities that can be measured and potentially improved.
Those activities that are mission critical will especially warrant address for improvement.
