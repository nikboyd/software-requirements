Interfaces have three primary kinds:

* APIs = application programming interfaces
* UXs or UIs = user experience interfaces
* reports

Both APIs and UXs generally reveal information and allow it to be operated upon. 
Reports simply reveal information, typically in some predefined and structured manner.
APIs typically manifest in solution designs at various levels of the code: functions, libraries, components, etc.
